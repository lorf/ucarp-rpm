This repository provides a script for building a ucarp RPM for RHEL, or
derivative, systems. This RPM is different from the EPEL package in that it is
built against the https://github.com/lorf/UCarp repo containing UDP broadcast
options.

Other than that, the RPM specific resources have been borrowed from the
EPEL source -- https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ucarp
